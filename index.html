            The best thing that I read was the fourth Harry Potter book titled The Goblet of Fire. Even though it was one of the longest books in the series it is my favourite.

            This book is my favourite because it is the most creative and has the most amount of characters. It also always had some new problem and interesting storyline to challenge the characters
